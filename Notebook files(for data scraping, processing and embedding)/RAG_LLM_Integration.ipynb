      "APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) là một diễn đàn kinh tế khu vực được thành lập vào năm 1989 để tận dụng sự phụ thuộc lẫn nhau ngày càng tăng của khu vực Châu Á - Thái Bình Dương. APEC có 21 thành viên, với mục tiêu tạo ra sự thịnh vượng lớn hơn cho người dân trong khu vực bằng cách thúc đẩy tăng trưởng cân bằng, toàn diện, bền vững, đổi mới và an toàn, đồng thời đẩy nhanh hội nhập kinh tế khu vực. APEC đảm bảo hàng hóa, dịch vụ, đầu tư và con người di chuyển trơn tru qua biên giới. Các thành viên tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại thông qua việc hợp lý hóa các thủ tục hải quan tại biên giới; thúc đẩy môi trường kinh doanh thuận lợi hơn; và điều phối các quy định và tiêu chuẩn trong khu vực. Đây là diễn đàn liên chính phủ toàn cầu duy nhất trên thế giới cam kết giảm các rào cản đối với thương mại và đầu tư mà không có các nghĩa vụ ràng buộc về mặt pháp lý. APEC đạt được các mục tiêu của mình bằng cách thúc đẩy đối thoại và đi đến các quyết định trên cơ sở đồng thuận, đồng thời coi trọng quan điểm của tất cả các thành viên.\n",
