We recognize the WTO has challenges and needs meaningful, necessary, and comprehensive reform to improve all its functions, through innovative approaches, to be more relevant and responsive in light of today’s realities. We commend the efforts to deepen discussions in the WTO on contemporary trade issues. We intend to work collaboratively through APEC's role as an incubator of ideas and support Members working together to deliver a successful Fourteenth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC14) in March 2026 in Cameroon.   5. We welcome the acceptance by 16 APEC economies of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, and call on remaining economies to complete their domestic procedures, and encourage all WTO Members to conclude negotiations on additional disciplines as soon as possible. We recognize the need for a constructive engagement on agriculture at the WTO. We also note the extension of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions as decided at MC13. We note the importance of enhancing predictability for the development of the digital economy. We welcome efforts to continue to reinvigorate work under the Work Program on Electronic Commerce.   6. We recognize the positive role of plurilateral negotiations at the WTO, including the Joint Statement Initiatives (JSIs), for advancing issues of interest to Members and to make the WTO more relevant. We welcome the progress made and emphasize their roles to address contemporary trade issues, foster new ideas, facilitate economic growth, and build momentum toward multilateral outcomes.

We welcome the study conducted by the APEC Policy Support Unit (PSU) on areas of convergence and divergence in trade agreements in the region and are committed to begin work this year in the areas of work on convergence and divergence identified in the Ichma Statement on A New Look at the FTAAP. We encourage further efforts and concrete work programs to enhance experience sharing, capacity building, and technical cooperation efforts. We welcome continued efforts in implementing the Capacity Building Needs Initiative (CBNI), aimed at strengthening member economies' readiness to participate in high standard and comprehensive undertakings.   8. We commit to ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation are accessible to all including by bridging digital divides and creating a safer digital ecosystem. We recognize the important role of the digitalization of the economy as a driver for innovation, productivity and economic growth across the region. As we approach the completion of the Work Program for the Implementation of the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap (AIDER) in 2025, we recognize the need to systematically develop an approach for the continued advancement of AIDER’s objective beyond 2025, in a way that addresses emerging challenges and opportunities in the rapidly evolving digital landscape and its impact on trade and investment.

We encourage working towards aligning our legal frameworks with the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) noting the different levels of readiness and capacity.    11. We recognize AI’s potential to fundamentally reshape the landscape of international trade. We acknowledge the importance of adopting AI-enabled procedures that contribute to trade facilitation, particularly with enhancing customs procedures. We encourage economies to share information on domestic approaches to relevant AI-related policy with the private sector, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), to help businesses identify opportunities and risks as well as improve competitiveness. To support ongoing efforts in AI-driven transformation and capacity building across the APEC region, we intend to discuss opportunities for voluntary information exchange on trade-related AI standards and technologies that takes into account and complements the work of appropriate specialized international organizations, processes, and other efforts.   12. We remain committed to the implementation of the APEC Connectivity Blueprint (2015-2025) by strengthening physical, institutional and people-to-people connectivity as well as taking advantage of digital connectivity.

We recognize the critical role that trade can play in achieving food security, minimizing food supply chain disruptions, and promoting open, fair, transparent, productive, sustainable, resilient, and innovative agri-food systems that benefit all.

We encourage economies to implement effective reforms in the services sector given its contribution to economic growth. We recognize the existing efforts to promote the APEC Services Competitiveness Roadmap (ASCR), which will reach its target date in 2025. We encourage officials to develop an ambitious framework for a post-2025 services roadmap. This framework may take into account the expanding role of digitally enabled services, as well as the impact of emerging technologies. In this regard, we further encourage cross-fora cooperation to discuss how to foster innovative services.   16. We welcome the updated Investment Facilitation Action Plan (IFAP) to support the implementation of the Aotearoa Plan of Action. We encourage officials to develop a work program to guide the implementation of the updated plan.   17. We emphasize APEC’s important role in promoting structural reforms to increase economic growth. We reaffirm the value of Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) in fostering transparency, predictability, and efficiency in the regulatory environment. We welcome ongoing efforts to strengthen cooperation on standards, and streamline conformity assessment procedures across APEC economies.

Recognizing important contributions of MSMEs and all people to economic growth, we commit to strengthening all of our people’s participation in regional and global markets by providing information tools and enhancing access to skill development. We recognize the Lima Roadmap to Promote the Transition to the Formal and Global Economies (2025-2040) as an initiative to broaden global trade participation and facilitate MSMEs’ resilient and sustainable growth and integration into the global economy and global supply chains. We reaffirm our dedication to the La Serena Roadmap for Women and Inclusive Growth (2019-2030), emphasizing the value of women’s active engagement in trade and economic activities to build a more dynamic Asia-Pacific community.

It convenes four official meetings and one informal meeting each year, with the outcomes reported to the APEC Ministerial Meeting and APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.     - Korea is represented by Lee Jiyoon, Deputy Director-General for International Economic Affairs at the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in her capacity as Korea’s Senior Official.      Notably, during SOM2, all 21 APEC member economies endorsed the establishment of the APEC “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations,” which aims to support young professionals’ participation in the economy and capacity building, recognizing the young generation as key drivers in advancing this year’s APEC theme, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow.” At the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Peru last November, Korea formally proposed the establishment of the “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations” and pledged an initial contribution of USD 1 million to launch this initiative. The Fund is expected to support a wide array of projects, including: knowledge exchange among young professionals in education, science, and policy; capacity-building in emerging digital technologies such as ICT and artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data, and advanced manufacturing technologies; and the promotion of youth entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, it will provide support for policy research that responds to the needs and challenges facing the young generation such as issues related to demographic changes and environmental challenges. The Fund’s establishment will be finalized upon completion of the remaining administrative procedures within APEC.      Furthermore, Korea presented the key elements of its key deliverables for APEC 2025, namely “APEC AI Initiative” and “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” during SOM2 and various sub-fora meetings. These elements are expected to serve as the basis for the outcome documents of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting later this year.      The proposed “APEC AI Initiative” aims to harness AI to accelerate economic transformation, foster resilient growth, drive technological advancement, and empower the workforce. This initiative envisions: providing strategic direction for successful AI transitions within APEC; building AI capacities across all sectors, including governments, businesses, workers, and consumers; and promoting a sustainable and robust ecosystem for AI-related infrastructure investment.      The proposed “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” seeks to address population trends such as declining birth rates and population aging, which are shared challenges across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative aims to turn these demographic challenges into opportunities for future growth and innovation by: promoting sustainable systems to support aging societies; fostering medical and technological innovation; and enhancing economic participation for women.     In conjunction with SOM2, a series of ministerial meetings were also held, including the Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting (HRDMM) (May 11–13), the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting (May 13–15), and the Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting (May 15–16). At the HRDMM, a Joint Statement was adopted, outlining shared commitments to building sustainable labor markets and jobs for the future.     On the sidelines of SOM2, Korea held bilateral consultations with Senior Officials from China, Peru, Australia, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei, engaging in broad discussions on key deliverables for APEC 2025 and agendas for ministerial meetings.     The Third Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM3) is scheduled to take place in Incheon between July and August.

It convenes four official meetings and one informal meeting each year, with the outcomes reported to the APEC Ministerial Meeting and APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.     - Korea is represented by Lee Jiyoon, Deputy Director-General for International Economic Affairs at the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in her capacity as Korea’s Senior Official.      Notably, during SOM2, all 21 APEC member economies endorsed the establishment of the APEC “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations,” which aims to support young professionals’ participation in the economy and capacity building, recognizing the young generation as key drivers in advancing this year’s APEC theme, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow.” At the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Peru last November, Korea formally proposed the establishment of the “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations” and pledged an initial contribution of USD 1 million to launch this initiative. The Fund is expected to support a wide array of projects, including: knowledge exchange among young professionals in education, science, and policy; capacity-building in emerging digital technologies such as ICT and artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data, and advanced manufacturing technologies; and the promotion of youth entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, it will provide support for policy research that responds to the needs and challenges facing the young generation such as issues related to demographic changes and environmental challenges. The Fund’s establishment will be finalized upon completion of the remaining administrative procedures within APEC.      Furthermore, Korea presented the key elements of its key deliverables for APEC 2025, namely “APEC AI Initiative” and “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” during SOM2 and various sub-fora meetings. These elements are expected to serve as the basis for the outcome documents of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting later this year.      The proposed “APEC AI Initiative” aims to harness AI to accelerate economic transformation, foster resilient growth, drive technological advancement, and empower the workforce. This initiative envisions: providing strategic direction for successful AI transitions within APEC; building AI capacities across all sectors, including governments, businesses, workers, and consumers; and promoting a sustainable and robust ecosystem for AI-related infrastructure investment.      The proposed “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” seeks to address population trends such as declining birth rates and population aging, which are shared challenges across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative aims to turn these demographic challenges into opportunities for future growth and innovation by: promoting sustainable systems to support aging societies; fostering medical and technological innovation; and enhancing economic participation for women.     In conjunction with SOM2, a series of ministerial meetings were also held, including the Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting (HRDMM) (May 11–13), the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting (May 13–15), and the Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting (May 15–16). At the HRDMM, a Joint Statement was adopted, outlining shared commitments to building sustainable labor markets and jobs for the future.     On the sidelines of SOM2, Korea held bilateral consultations with Senior Officials from China, Peru, Australia, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei, engaging in broad discussions on key deliverables for APEC 2025 and agendas for ministerial meetings.     The Third Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM3) is scheduled to take place in Incheon between July and August.

It convenes four official meetings and one informal meeting each year, with the outcomes reported to the APEC Ministerial Meeting and APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting.     - Korea is represented by Lee Jiyoon, Deputy Director-General for International Economic Affairs at the ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in her capacity as Korea’s Senior Official.      Notably, during SOM2, all 21 APEC member economies endorsed the establishment of the APEC “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations,” which aims to support young professionals’ participation in the economy and capacity building, recognizing the young generation as key drivers in advancing this year’s APEC theme, “Building a Sustainable Tomorrow.” At the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Peru last November, Korea formally proposed the establishment of the “Sub-Fund on Prosperity of Future Generations” and pledged an initial contribution of USD 1 million to launch this initiative. The Fund is expected to support a wide array of projects, including: knowledge exchange among young professionals in education, science, and policy; capacity-building in emerging digital technologies such as ICT and artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data, and advanced manufacturing technologies; and the promotion of youth entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, it will provide support for policy research that responds to the needs and challenges facing the young generation such as issues related to demographic changes and environmental challenges. The Fund’s establishment will be finalized upon completion of the remaining administrative procedures within APEC.      Furthermore, Korea presented the key elements of its key deliverables for APEC 2025, namely “APEC AI Initiative” and “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” during SOM2 and various sub-fora meetings. These elements are expected to serve as the basis for the outcome documents of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting later this year.      The proposed “APEC AI Initiative” aims to harness AI to accelerate economic transformation, foster resilient growth, drive technological advancement, and empower the workforce. This initiative envisions: providing strategic direction for successful AI transitions within APEC; building AI capacities across all sectors, including governments, businesses, workers, and consumers; and promoting a sustainable and robust ecosystem for AI-related infrastructure investment.      The proposed “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” seeks to address population trends such as declining birth rates and population aging, which are shared challenges across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative aims to turn these demographic challenges into opportunities for future growth and innovation by: promoting sustainable systems to support aging societies; fostering medical and technological innovation; and enhancing economic participation for women.     In conjunction with SOM2, a series of ministerial meetings were also held, including the Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting (HRDMM) (May 11–13), the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting (May 13–15), and the Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting (May 15–16). At the HRDMM, a Joint Statement was adopted, outlining shared commitments to building sustainable labor markets and jobs for the future.     On the sidelines of SOM2, Korea held bilateral consultations with Senior Officials from China, Peru, Australia, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei, engaging in broad discussions on key deliverables for APEC 2025 and agendas for ministerial meetings.     The Third Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM3) is scheduled to take place in Incheon between July and August.

The Fund’s establishment will be finalized upon completion of the remaining administrative procedures within APEC.      Furthermore, Korea presented the key elements of its key deliverables for APEC 2025, namely “APEC AI Initiative” and “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” during SOM2 and various sub-fora meetings. These elements are expected to serve as the basis for the outcome documents of the APEC Leaders’ Meeting later this year.      The proposed “APEC AI Initiative” aims to harness AI to accelerate economic transformation, foster resilient growth, drive technological advancement, and empower the workforce. This initiative envisions: providing strategic direction for successful AI transitions within APEC; building AI capacities across all sectors, including governments, businesses, workers, and consumers; and promoting a sustainable and robust ecosystem for AI-related infrastructure investment.      The proposed “The Collaborative Framework for Demographic Changes in the APEC Community” seeks to address population trends such as declining birth rates and population aging, which are shared challenges across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative aims to turn these demographic challenges into opportunities for future growth and innovation by: promoting sustainable systems to support aging societies; fostering medical and technological innovation; and enhancing economic participation for women.     In conjunction with SOM2, a series of ministerial meetings were also held, including the Human Resources Development Ministerial Meeting (HRDMM) (May 11–13), the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting (May 13–15), and the Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) Meeting (May 15–16). At the HRDMM, a Joint Statement was adopted, outlining shared commitments to building sustainable labor markets and jobs for the future.     On the sidelines of SOM2, Korea held bilateral consultations with Senior Officials from China, Peru, Australia, the Russian Federation, and Chinese Taipei, engaging in broad discussions on key deliverables for APEC 2025 and agendas for ministerial meetings.     The Third Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM3) is scheduled to take place in Incheon between July and August.
