The host economy will chair the annual Economic Leaders’ Meeting, Ministerial Meetings, Senior Officials’ Meetings, the APEC Business Advisory Council and the APEC Study Centers Consortium.The first of these meetings is the Informal Senior Officials’ Meeting (ISOM), held the year prior to the host year.Throughout the APEC year, more than 200 events are held, including sectoral ministerial meetings, committee and subcommittee meetings, working groups, experts’ meetings, APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) meetings, the APEC CEO Summit, as well as seminars, symposiums, and workshops for institutional capacity building. All these meetings are used to progress APEC’s agenda and ongoing projects, as well as form new initiatives often led by the host economy.
